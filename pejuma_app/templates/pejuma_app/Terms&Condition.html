      <p>We make no representations or warranties with respect to this portal or its content, or any product or service available on or promoted through this portal. This site and all of its content (including user-generated content) are provided on an “as is,” “as available” basis, without representations or warranties of any kind. To the fullest extent permitted by law, peopleware and affiliates, and their service providers and licensors disclaim any and all representations and warranties, whether express, implied, arising by statute, custom, course of dealing, course of performance or in any other way, with respect to this site, its content, and any products or services available or promoted through this portal.

      <p>We do not represent or warrant that this portal, its servers, or any transmissions sent from us or through this portal will be free of any harmful components (including viruses).</p>
      <p>Peopleware does not endorse and is not responsible for statements, advice and opinions made by anyone other than authorized peopleware spokespersons. We do not endorse and are not responsible for any statements, advice or opinions contained in user-generated content and such statements, advice and opinions do not in any way reflect the statements, advice and opinions of peopleware. We do not make any representations or warranties against the possibility of deletion, misdelivery or failure to store communications, personalized settings, or other data. You accept that our shareholders, owners, officers, directors, employees and other representatives shall have the benefit of this clause.</p>
      <p>Applicable law may not allow the limitation of certain warranties, so all or part of this disclaimer of warranties may not apply to you.</p>
      <h2>Limitation of liability</h2>
      <p>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable laws we, on behalf of our directors, officers, employees, agents, suppliers, licensors and service providers, exclude and disclaim liability for any losses and expenses of whatever nature and howsoever arising including, without limitation, any direct, indirect, general, special, punitive, incidental or consequential damages; loss of use; loss of data; loss caused by a virus; loss of income or profit; loss of or damage to property; claims of third parties; or other losses of any kind or character, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages or losses, arising out of or in connection with the use of this portal.

This limitation of liability applies whether the alleged liability is based on contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability or any other basis.</p>

      <p>This site gives you specific legal rights and you may also have other rights which vary from country to country. Some jurisdictions do not allow certain kinds of limitations or exclusions of liability, so the limitations and exclusions set out in these terms of use may not apply to you. Other jurisdictions allow limitations and exclusions subject to certain conditions. In such a case the limitations and exclusions set out in these terms of use shall apply to the fullest extent permitted by the laws of such applicable jurisdictions. Your statutory rights as a consumer, if any, are not affected by these provisions, and we do not seek to exclude or limit liability for fraudulent misrepresentation.</p>

      <p>This portal may provide links to other websites operated by third parties (i.e. Social media websites, vendor pages, websites of other corporations, limited liability companies, etc.). Because we have no control over third-party websites, we are not responsible for the availability of those websites and do not endorse and are not responsible or liable for any content, advertising, services, products, or other materials on or available from such websites. Peopleware shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with the use of or reliance on any content, advertising, services, products, or other materials on or available from such websites.

      <h2>Severability</h2>
      <p>If any provision of these terms of use is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to law, such provision will be changed and interpreted so as to best accomplish the objectives of the original provision to the fullest extent allowed by law and the remaining provisions of these terms of use will remain in full force and effect.</p>
